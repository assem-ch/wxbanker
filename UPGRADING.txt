== UPGRADING ==
Upgrading wxBanker to a new version is very easy. The most important
part is ensuring your bank.db file, which holds all of your accounts
and transactions, is in the right place. To do this either:

*) Copy the bank.db file from the old release into the new release
   folder. Then run wxbanker.py from the new release. Be sure to
   update any shortcuts you may have created to reflect the new
   location. It is safe to delete the old directory if you like.

 OR

*) Select all of the files from the new release folder, and copy them
   into your old release folder, overwriting any existing files. Now
   run wxbanker.py as usual.


Thanks for using wxBanker. If you have any problems, questions, or

Hello, and thanks for using wxBanker.

== REQUIREMENTS ==
In order to use wxBanker you will need:
 - Python >= 2.5
 - wxPython >= 2.8
 * numpy (optional, for computing balance over time)

== INSTALL ==
There is no need to "install" wxBanker, it just runs from wherever it is located.

== RUNNING ==
Use python to run wxbanker.py wherever it is located. On Windows this means just double-clicking wxbanker.py.

Example: "python ~/wxBanker/wxbanker.py"

In many cases running wxbanker.py itself should work as well, as long as Python is installed as expected.

Example: "~/wxBanker/wxbanker.py"

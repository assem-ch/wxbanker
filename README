== REQUIREMENTS ==
 - Python >= 2.5
 - wxPython >= 2.8
 * numpy >= 1.04 (completely optional; provides improved graph data)

See "INSTALLING" below for instructions on installing these
dependencies on your specific operating system.


== INSTALL ==
 - Windows 2000/XP/Vista:
   - Download and install python from:
      http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.5.2/python-2.5.2.msi
   - Download and install wxPython from:
      http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.8.0-py25.exe
   - Optionally, for improved graph data, download and install
      numpy-1.1.0-win32-superpack-python2.5.exe from:
      http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&package_id=175103

 - Ubuntu/Debian
   - Python 2.5 is already installed on your system!
   - To install wxPython, use apt-get or synaptic to install python-wxgtk2.8
   - To (optionally) install numpy, use apt-get or synaptic to install python-numpy.

 - Mac OSX (PPC or Intel)
   - If you are using Leopard 10.5 or newer, you already have Python 2.5 installed.
     Otherwise, download and install python from:
      http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.5.2/python-2.5.2-macosx.dmg
   - Download and install wxPython from:
      http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython2.8-osx-unicode-2.8.8.0-universal-py2.5.dmg
   - Optionally, for improved graph data, download and install
      numpy-1.1.0-py2.5-macosx10.5.dmg from:
      http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&package_id=175103

Once you have installed Python, wxPython, and optionally numpy
using the instructions above, you are set. There is no need to
"install" wxBanker, it just runs from wherever it is located.

See the below section "RUNNING" for instructions on running wxBanker.


== RUNNING ==
Use python to run wxbanker.py wherever it is located. On Windows,
and usually elsewhere, this simply means double-clicking wxbanker.py.

Otherwise:

Example: "python ~/wxBanker/wxbanker.py"

In many cases running wxbanker.py itself should work as well, as long as Python is installed as expected.

Example: "~/wxBanker/wxbanker.py"

* new account / rename account doesn't work
* enter in transaction fields doesn't enter transaction (works from date, not desc/amount)
* pending recurring transaction banner is all black
* account action icons are cut off by a pixel on each side
* up/down arrows only adjust the date if the date field is focused, not from desc/amount
* changing a date of a transaction to an invalid date leaves the ctrl stuck there
